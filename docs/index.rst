Zigbee is a portable, low-power software networking protocol that provides connectivity over a mesh network based on the IEEE 802.15.4 radio protocol.
It also defines an application layer that provides interoperability among all Zigbee devices.

The |addon| for the |NCS| provides support for developing Zigbee applications based on the third-party precompiled ZBOSS stack.
This stack is included as the :ref:`zigbee_zboss` library (version |zboss_version|).
In combination with the |NCS|, the |addon| allows for development of low-power connected solutions.
